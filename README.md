# Dynamic Property Price Prediction: A Predictive System for Smart Real-Estate Decision

## Project Overview
In today's dynamic real estate market, data-driven insights are essential for making informed property investment decisions. This project Dynamic Property Price Prediction employs machine learning techniques to predict property prices by incorporating not only property details but also key livability factors like proximity to transit, schools, healthcare, and retail amenities.

This repository is designed for data scientists, real estate analysts, and decision-makers who aim to leverage machine learning models and data science techniques for better property price forecasting.

## Dataset Scope and Potential
The dataset used in this project spans residential property sales data from the city of Milwaukee, including property features like square footage, number of rooms, and sale prices, as well as livability data extracted from OpenStreetMap. The dataset offers a foundation for analyzing the relationship between property features and their prices, while also incorporating livability factors to improve prediction accuracy.

In the future, the scope of this dataset can be expanded to include additional cities or regions, which would provide more generalizable insights for property price forecasting across diverse geographic areas.

## Project Workflow

📊 1. Livability Factor Analysis

-Objective: Identify how nearby amenities impact property prices.
- Methods: Used geolocation data and the OpenStreetMap API to extract proximity to amenities like transit, education, healthcare, and retail.
- Results: Identified significant livability factors that influence the residential sale price in urban areas.

🤖2. Price Prediction

- Objective: Build predictive models to estimate property prices.
- Models Used:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
- Findings: Machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed traditional models, achieving R² values above 0.7.

💵 3. Feature Importance

- Objective: Evaluate the importance of different features in predicting property prices.
- Methods: Generated feature importance plots to identify key predictors, including property size, location, and nearby amenities.
- Results: Features like `FinishedSqft` and district were identified as top predictors.

⏳ 4. Model Evaluation

- Objective: Assess the performance of the machine learning models.
- Evaluation Metrics: 
  - R² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Findings: XGBoost consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest R² on test data.
